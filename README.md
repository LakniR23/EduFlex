# EduFlex
For our group project in the 1st year, 2nd semester at SLIIT, we developed a website called "EduFlex," an Online Teacher Trainer platform. The website was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL to deliver a simple and user-friendly experience. 

We divided the webpages of the platform among our team members, with each member contributing to the development of the platform. Each person performed an entire CRUD part.
